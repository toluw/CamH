# CamH
This projects calculate the distance from a focused object in camera to the camera device

The app uses basic principles of trigonometry for calculating the measures

Given the height of the camera from the base of the object, this application can calculate the distance of the object from the user

Steps for using the application:

1. Select the units of measurement required.
2. Input the height (approximate) of the camera from the base of the target object.
3. Click the 'Adjust Height' button
4. Point the marker at the base of the object, then select 'Get Distance' This will result in calculating the approximate distance of the object from the      user.

Values can be reset by hitting the 'Reset' button.
